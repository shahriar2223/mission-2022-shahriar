            <h1>Stay Focused on <span class="orange-color"><br> Mission 2022</span></h1>
            <p>My passion is to become a Fullstack Web Developer. However this is not a path of bed and roses. It needs
                practice, it needs hardwork, it needs staying motivated. So my Primary goal in this year is to stay
                focused,
                motivated and learning Web Development properly. This is a year of challenge, this is a year of remain
                on the
                way, this is a year of existence.</p>
